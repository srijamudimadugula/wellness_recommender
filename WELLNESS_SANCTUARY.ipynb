While platforms like YouTube host millions of wellness videos, they primarily optimize for *engagement* (watch time, click-through rate) rather than *user wellbeing*. A stressed user searching for relief is often bombarded with overwhelming choices or high-energy content that exacerbates their state. There is a lack of intelligent agents that can:\n",

        "- **YouTube Data API (Primary Data Source):** We do not rely on a static CSV. Instead, we query the live YouTube Data API to fetch real-time metadata (titles, descriptions, view counts, likes) from trusted wellness channels (e.g., 'Yoga With Adriene', 'Pick Up Limes'). This ensures the content is always fresh.\n",
        "- **Synthetic Interaction Logs:** To train the Reinforcement Learning agent effectively during development, we simulate user 'clicks' and 'watch times' based on probabilistic distributions.\n",

        "**2b. Data Exploration:**\n",
        "We investigate key video features that correlate with quality:\n",
        "- **Duration:** Short videos (5-15m) are better for 'anxiety' breaks; longer ones (20m+) for 'daily flows'.\n",
        "- **Engagement Ratio:** Calculated as $\\frac{\\text{Likes}}{\\text{Views}}$, this is a cleaner signal of quality than raw views (which just measures popularity).\n",

        "**2c. Cleaning, Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:**\n",
        "Raw data from APIs is noisy and unscaled. We perform the following transformations:\n",
        "1.  **Log-Normalization:** `log_views = log(1 + views)`. This compresses the range of view counts (which follows a Power Law) so that a video with 10M views doesn't overpower the model compared to one with 100k views.\n",
        "2.  **Z-Score Scaling:** We use a `FeatureNormalizer` (StandardScaler) to center feature distributions around 0 with a standard deviation of 1. This is crucial for the mathematical stability of the LinUCB matrix inversion ($A^{-1}$).\n",
        "\n",
        "**2d. Handling Missing Values and Noise:**\n",
        "- **Robust API Handling:** Real-world APIs fail. Our `YouTubeService` includes a `try-except` fallback to a curated `MockYouTubeService` if the API quota is exhausted or connectivity drops.\n",
        "- **Data Imputation:** Videos missing explicit tags are auto-tagged based on keyword extraction from their titles using `KeyBERT`.\n"

        "-   **Step 2 (Retrieval):** The system fetches ~50 candidate videos matching the emotion tag.\n",
